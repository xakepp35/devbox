    # On the frontend, however, it instead checks if particular strings are included in the `available_features`
    # Unfortunately there is no canonical variable with all the features, so we have to hardcode.
    # Use `rg --pcre2 -INo "(?<=allows_to\?[^:*]:|allowsTo\(')[a-z_]*" | sort -u` to generate this list:
